# % is a wildcard that matches any sequence of characters, 
# and it is used to create a pattern. 
# So, %.o means "any target ending with .o".

# -c: This is a compiler flag that instructs the compiler 
# to generate an object file (.o) without linking. 
# It tells the compiler to stop after the compilation phase.

# $<: This is an automatic variable that represents 
# the first prerequisite (dependency) of the rule. 
# In this context, it represents the source file (%.c).
